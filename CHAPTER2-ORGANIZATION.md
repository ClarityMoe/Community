# Chapter 2 - Organizational Structure

We, Clarity, maintain a hierarchy of highly disciplined hobbyists and programmers in our helm to promote our vision and mission
set in the preamble. 

To ensure this happens, we have a standard hierarchy for this organization:

- **Leader**
  - The leader is who governs this organization and reflects its interests. They have the full authority to the fate of the organization
  and they have the authority to ratify guidelines with proper consultation from other administrative groups.


- **Co-leader**
  - The co-leader shares the same responsibilities and duties of this organization. However, the co-leader has limited responsibilties
  and is only active when the Leader is not present, or a special duty of interest has been set to him/her. They also have the right to ratify
  new guidelines, but requires consultation from the Leader and other administrative groups.
  
  
- **Administrators**
  - The administrators are the supplementary hand of power of the Leader and Co-leader. They have the same responsibilities as Leader and co-leader
  but they require auditing and permission request from the leader or co-leader.


- **Moderators**
  - Moderators are selected by administrator on a case-by-case basis, and they are responsible for regulating the community, but all of the administrative
  actions require permission request from the Administrator.
  
  
- **Project Managers**
  - Project Managers runs their own projects or a related project within their interest scope, they have administrative powers on their project repositories,
  and are responsible in electing other managers for their project.
